        <p> As a seasoned digital marketer and creative developer, I have spent more than a decade producing
            high-performing video
            ads and animations for brands across a variety of industries. Drawing from my background in marketing
            strategy, design,
            and analytics, I create videos that pair compelling visual storytelling with data-driven intent—ensuring
            each asset is
            both engaging and conversion-focused.<br><br>

            I am highly proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud applications, including After Effects, Premiere Pro,
            Photoshop,
            Illustrator, and Animate, enabling full end-to-end production from concepting and design to animation and
            final editing.
            My work supports brand initiatives, product launches, paid advertising campaigns, and social media growth
            for global
            companies.<br><br>

            The pieces featured here represent my approach to creating polished, purpose-driven video content that
            elevates brand
            presence and drives measurable performance.
